        Since I was a child, I've had a huge interest 
        in <b>outer space</b>.
        I loved looking at the stars in the night sky and 
        wondering what those distant worlds were like.
        My dream was to one day travel in a <u>spaceship</u> from
        planet to planet.

        In space, you experience a feeling of weightlessness. 
        The Earth looks like a small blue marble from there.
         
        Scientists say there could be life outside of Earth.
        This idea makes me even more curious.
        I learned in chemistry that the formula
        for water is H<sub>2</sub>O. 
        Just imagine, 
        could we find water like this on another planet?

        Perhaps this dream of mine will come true one day. 
        I am waiting for that day. To learn more,
